        This is a short recording of me reading a poem called "Azaleas" by Kim Sowol along with a digital flower.
        <br><br>
            Even if you leave,
            <br>
            being tired of me,
            <br>
            Meekly, I would let you go without a murmur.
            <br><br>
            On Mt. Yaksan, Yeongbyeon,
            <br>
            Picking an armful of azaleas,
            <br>
            I would scatter them on your path.
            <br><br>
            With every step you take,
            <br>
            please tread on the flowers
            <br>
            to your heart's content.
            <br><br>
            Even if you leave,
            <br>
            being tired of me,
            <br>
            I would never ever shed tears.
            <br><br>
